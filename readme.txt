I'm trying to run realtime, polymorphic note detection, and I came across this page: https://github.com/magenta/magenta/tree/main/magenta/models/onsets_frames_transcription/realtime

I would like to run it locall to try it out.

Nothing has been installed yet.

Can you help me create a virtual environment, install what is needed, to help me run this demo?

We can use this document to track our progress.

python start_web_demo.py
